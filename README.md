# Smart-CPU-Scheduling-Visualizer
This project is a web-based CPU Scheduling Visualizer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helps understand how different CPU scheduling algorithms like FCFS, SJF, SRTF, Round Robin, and Priority work with the help of a Gantt chart. It also gives a smart suggestion for the best algorithm based on performance.
